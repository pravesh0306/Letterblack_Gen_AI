- **After:** Detailed explanations, customization guidance, and professional code formatting

**Improved Methods:**
- `generatePositionResponse()` - Enhanced wiggle with parameter explanations
- `generatePingPongResponse()` - Added detailed usage instructions
- `generateBounceResponse()` - Formatted complex physics code for readability

### 3. **Intelligent Layer Analysis**
- **Before:** Simple "You have X layers selected"
- **After:** Context-aware analysis with actionable suggestions

**Features:**
- Smart suggestions based on layer count (1, 2-5, 5+ layers)
- Contextual recommendations for next actions
- Educational guidance for new users

### 4. **Advanced Project File Analysis**
- **Before:** Basic file listing
- **After:** Intelligent categorization and insights

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic file type categorization (video, audio, images, compositions)
- Performance tips and organization suggestions
- Quick action recommendations
- Missing assets guidance

### 5. **Comprehensive Effects Analysis**
- **Before:** Simple effects listing

- Performance impact assessment
- Optimization recommendations
- Educational effect suggestions

### 6. **Smart Project Organization Tool**
- **Before:** "Coming soon" placeholder
- **After:** Complete automated project organization script

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic folder creation (Footage, Compositions, Audio, Images, Solids)
- Intelligent file type detection and sorting
- Safe undo group implementation
- Progress feedback and error handling

### 7. **Dynamic Capabilities Display**
