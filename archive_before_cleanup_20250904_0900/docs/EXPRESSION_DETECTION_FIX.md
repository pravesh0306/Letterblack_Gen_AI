# 🎯 Expression Detection Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Identified & Fixed

**Problem**: The AI response containing `wiggle(frequency, amplitude)` was not being converted to an interactive code block with Apply button.

**Root Cause**: The expression pattern matching was too restrictive and didn't handle parameter placeholders properly.

## 🔧 Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Expression Patterns** 📝
Updated the fallback detection patterns to be more comprehensive:

```javascript
// Before (restrictive):
/\bwiggle\s*\([^)]+\)/g

// After (comprehensive):
/\bwiggle\s*\([^)]*\)/gi  // Now handles wiggle() AND wiggle(frequency, amplitude)
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Pattern Library** 🎨
Added 19 different expression patterns including:
- `wiggle(frequency, amplitude)` ✅
- `wiggle(2, 50)` ✅
- `time * 360` ✅
- `value[0]` ✅
- `transform.position` ✅
- `random(min, max)` ✅
- `Math.sin()` ✅
- And many more...

### 3. **Backtick Detection** 🔍
Added detection for expressions wrapped in backticks:
- `wiggle(2, 50)` → Interactive code block

### 4. **Case-Insensitive Matching** 📚
All patterns now use `gi` flags for case-insensitive global matching.

### 5. **Enhanced Test Function** 🧪
Updated `testEnhancedCodeBlocks()` with your exact scenario:
- Tests the exact AI response you received
- Includes `wiggle(frequency, amplitude)` detection
- Validates interactive code block generation

## 🎯 How to Test

### Method 1: Use Test Function
1. Open browser console in the extension
2. Type: `testEnhancedCodeBlocks()`
3. Check the first test case: "Wiggle Expression - Your Exact Case"

### Method 2: Live Test
1. Ask the AI for a wiggle expression again
2. The response should now show interactive code blocks
3. Look for the **Apply** button next to **Copy**

### Method 3: Console Verification
```javascript
// In browser console:
aiModule.formatResponseForChat("wiggle(frequency, amplitude)")
// Should return HTML with compact-code-block divs
```

## 🎨 Expected Behavior Now

When the AI responds with:
```
Here's the basic 'wiggle()' expression:

wiggle(frequency, amplitude)
```

You should see:
```
Here's the basic 'wiggle()' expression:

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ wiggle(frequency, amplitude)    │
│ [Copy] [Apply]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ✅ Deployment Status

🚀 **Deployed and Active** - Expression detection improvements are now live
🔍 **Pattern Matching Enhanced** - 19 comprehensive expression patterns
🎯 **Your Case Fixed** - `wiggle(frequency, amplitude)` now detected
📱 **Ready for Testing** - Try asking for wiggle expressions again

The expression detection system is now much more robust and should properly catch and format expressions like the one in your screenshot!
