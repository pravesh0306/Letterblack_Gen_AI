# 🤖 AI Assistant Response Improvements

## ✅ Enhancement Summary

The AI assistant has been upgraded to provide **minimal, concise responses** with **smart interactive code blocks**.

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Minimal Response Formatting**
- Removes verbose explanatory text
- Eliminates redundant phrases like "Here's an expression that will..."
- Provides direct, to-the-point answers
- Focuses on the actual code rather than lengthy descriptions

### 2. **Smart Code Block Detection**
The system now automatically detects and categorizes code:

- **🟡 Expressions**: After Effects expressions (wiggle, time, value, etc.)
- **🔵 ExtendScript**: After Effects scripting (app., project., comp, etc.)  
- **🟨 JavaScript**: General JavaScript code (function, var, console, etc.)
- **🟢 Generic Code**: Fallback for other code types

### 3. **Context-Aware Button Sets**

#### For **Expressions** 📐:
- **Copy** button - Copy to clipboard
- **Apply** button - Apply to selected property in After Effects

#### For **Scripts** 🚀:
- **Copy** button - Copy to clipboard  
- **Run** button - Execute script in After Effects

#### Visual Indicators:
- **Gold border** for expressions
- **Blue border** for ExtendScript
- **Yellow border** for JavaScript
- **Green border** for generic code

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Code Detection Logic
```javascript
detectCodeType(code) {
    // Detects expressions: wiggle, time, value, transform, etc.
    // Detects scripts: app., project., comp, layer, etc.
    // Detects JavaScript: function, var, console, etc.
}
```

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Minimal responses** with code properly formatted in interactive boxes
- **Smart button selection** based on code type
- **Visual feedback** with success states and hover effects
- **One-click execution** for both expressions and scripts

## 🎨 Visual Design

- **Clean, compact code blocks** with syntax highlighting
- **Color-coded borders** for instant recognition
- **Hover effects** with type-specific colors
- **Success animations** for user feedback

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Expression Response:
```
wiggle(2, 50)
[Copy] [Apply]
```

### Script Response:
```
app.project.activeItem.selectedLayers[0].name = "New Layer";
[Copy] [Run]
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status
