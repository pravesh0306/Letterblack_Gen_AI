## 🎯 **KEY ACHIEVEMENTS**

### 1. **Smart Intent Classification**
```javascript
// Now the AI understands user intent
classifyIntent("make layer wiggle") → EXPRESSION (confidence: 12)
classifyIntent("create new comp") → SCRIPT (confidence: 8) 
classifyIntent("add gaussian blur") → EFFECT (confidence: 15)
```

### 2. **Enhanced Code Block UI**
- **Before**: Generic code blocks with basic copy button
- **After**: Type-specific actions (Apply Expression, Run Script, Package Panel)

### 3. **Professional Integration**
- **Event Delegation**: Better performance with `data-action` attributes
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear type badges and professional styling
- **Context Awareness**: Smart button logic based on code type
