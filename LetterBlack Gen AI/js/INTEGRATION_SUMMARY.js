/**
 * INTEGRATION SUMMARY - Advanced Features from Abilities Folder
 * Successfully integrated into main extension
 * 
 * COMPLETED INTEGRATIONS:
 * ========================
 * 
 * 1. ✅ VOICE FEATURES SYSTEM (from abilities/3.html)
 *    - Full Text-to-Speech (TTS) integration for AI responses
 *    - Speech-to-Text (STT) voice input for chat
 *    - Audio visualizer with wave rings during speech
 *    - Mute/unmute controls on floating mascot
 *    - Voice settings panel in main settings
 *    - File attachment system with preview
 *    - Location: src/js/features/voice-features.js
 *    - CSS: src/css/components/voice-features.css
 * 
 * 2. ✅ DEPENDENCY CHECKER SYSTEM (from abilities/2/modules/dependency-checker.js)
 *    - Real-time system validation and status checking
 *    - CEP, After Effects, API availability monitoring
 *    - User-friendly status reporting with recommendations
 *    - Auto-initialization with delayed status display
 *    - Location: src/js/utils/dependency-checker.js
 * 
 * 3. ✅ YOUTUBE ANALYSIS CASCADE (from abilities/2/youtube-analysis-cascade.js)
 *    - Multi-tier fallback system for YouTube video analysis
 *    - AI-powered analysis → Browser processing → Pattern matching
 *    - After Effects-specific pattern recognition
 *    - Tutorial topic detection and suggestion system
 *    - Location: src/js/features/youtube-analysis-cascade.js
 * 
 * 4. ✅ UI INTEGRATION ENHANCEMENTS
 *    - Voice controls added to floating mascot with audio visualizer
 *    - Voice input button added to composer actions
 *    - File attachment button for multimedia support
 *    - Speech settings added to main settings panel
 *    - Updated main index.html with all new components
 * 
 * FEATURES NOT INTEGRATED (deemed unnecessary or redundant):
 * ===========================================================
 * 
 * ❌ Extension Completion Coordinator - Redundant with existing initialization
 * ❌ VS Code UI Controller - Too complex, existing UI working well
 * ❌ Enhanced UI Manager - Modal/notification system already exists
 * ❌ Test modules - Not needed in production
 * ❌ External transcription bridge - Too complex for initial release
 * ❌ Advanced video analyzer - YouTube cascade covers this
 * ❌ Jupyter notebook integration - Out of scope
 * ❌ Python environment checks - CEP extension limitation
 * 
 * CLEANUP ACTIONS RECOMMENDED:
 * ============================
 * 
 * 🗑️ DELETE ABILITIES FOLDER - All valuable features extracted
 * 🧹 Clean up redundant HTML snippets in abilities/1.html, 2.html, 3.html
 * 📦 Archive complex modules not suitable for CEP environment
 * 
 * INTEGRATION BENEFITS:
 * ====================
 * 
 * 🎯 Voice interaction makes extension more accessible
 * 🔍 Dependency checking provides better user feedback
 * 📺 YouTube analysis gives smart tutorial integration
 * 🚀 Maintains clean, focused architecture
 * 💪 Adds advanced features without complexity overhead
 * 🎨 Preserves VS Code design aesthetic
 * 
 * NEXT STEPS:
 * ===========
 * 
 * 1. Test voice features in After Effects environment
 * 2. Verify dependency checker accuracy
 * 3. Test YouTube analysis with real tutorials
 * 4. Clean up abilities folder if integration successful
 * 5. Update documentation with new features
 * 
 * STATUS: ✅ INTEGRATION COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING
